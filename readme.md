# ElevatorControl
A API Endpoint to control an elevator

## Build and run
1. Pull down this repository
2. Run the following command: <code>dotnet run</code>
3. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080/swagger to view documentation on the API

## Notes
The Scenario to move the elevator to the their current floor is the same as moving the elevator to a specific floor, the reason being is the service has no idea the location of the current floor the user is at. The button the user pushes obviously would have this information.
